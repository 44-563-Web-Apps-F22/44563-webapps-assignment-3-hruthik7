<h3>About Vampire Bat</h3>
<p>Vampire bats, species of the subfamily Desmodontinae,
 are leaf-nosed bats found in Central and South America.
 Their food source is blood, a dietary trait called hematophagy.
Three extant bat species feed solely on blood: the common vampire bat, the hairy-legged vampire bat, and the white-winged vampire bat.</p>
